Hi, I'm Xinyu Jessica Wang (王昕雨)! 👋

I’m an undergraduate student at UW–Madison 🦡, passionate about Human-centered AI. I’m grateful to be working with [Bilge Mutlu](https://bmutlu.github.io/) and for the mentorship of senior student [Christine Lee](https://christineplee.github.io/) (Check out their works—you won’t regret it!).

I’m incredibly thankful to the amazing people who have inspired and guided me on this journey. 🙇‍♀️🎓

📣 I’m actively looking for Ph.D. opportunities starting Fall 2025 in Human-centered AI.

You can find my curriculum vitae [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WoSETtpDUKVr9RmRANCWvNmj7TA8iufF/view?usp=drive_link).
