Hi, I'm Xinyu Jessica Wang (王昕雨)! 👋

I’m a first year PhD student in Computer Science at UW–Madison 🦡, passionate about Human-centered AI. I'm interested in designing adaptive AI agents that learn to collaborate and adapt through human interaction. I’m grateful to be working with [Prof. Bilge Mutlu](https://bmutlu.github.io/) and for the mentorship of senior student [Christine Lee](https://christineplee.github.io/) (Check out their works—you won’t regret it!).

I’m incredibly thankful to the amazing people who have inspired and guided me on this journey. 🙇‍♀️🎓

📣 I’m actively looking for summer internships Fall 2026!
