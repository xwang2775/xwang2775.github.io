Hi, I’m Xinyu Jessica Wang (王昕雨)! 👋

I’m a first year PhD student in Computer Science at UW–Madison 🦡. My research centers on **Agentic AI** and **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)**, with the goal of building AI systems that can act, reason, and collaborate in the real world. I study how agents use tools, interact with humans, and operate within complex socio-technical environments. Beyond improving model capability, I also focus on designing human-centered interaction paradigms that make AI systems reliable, understandable, and aligned with human intent.

More broadly, I aim to develop AI agents that augment human decision-making, coordinate with people and other agents, and ultimately reshape workflows by reducing cognitive and operational burden while preserving human oversight and control.

I’m grateful to be working with [Prof. Bilge Mutlu](https://bmutlu.github.io/) and [Prof. Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu) for the mentorship of senior student [Christine Lee](https://christineplee.github.io/) and [Haoyue Bai](https://haoyuebaizju.github.io) (Check out their works—you won’t regret it!). I’m incredibly thankful to the amazing people who have inspired and guided me on this journey. 🙇‍♀️🎓

📣 I’m actively looking for summer internships 2026!
