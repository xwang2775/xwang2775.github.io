Hi, I'm Xinyu Jessica Wang (王昕雨)! 👋

I'm a first year PhD student in Computer Science at UW–Madison 🦡. My research centers on **Agentic AI** and **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)**, with the goal of building AI systems that can act, reason, and collaborate in the real world. I study how agents use tools, interact with humans, and operate within complex socio-technical environments. Beyond improving model capability, I also focus on designing human-centered interaction paradigms that make AI systems reliable, understandable, and aligned with human intent.

More broadly, I aim to develop AI agents that augment human decision-making, coordinate with people and other agents, and ultimately reshape workflows by reducing cognitive and operational burden while preserving human oversight and control.

My current research is supported by Honda Research Institute USA (HRI-US).

I'm grateful to work with [Prof. Bilge Mutlu](https://bmutlu.github.io/) and [Prof. Robert Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu), and for the mentorship of senior students [Christine Lee](https://christineplee.github.io/) and [Haoyue Bai](https://haoyuebaizju.github.io) (Check out their works—you won't regret it!). I'm incredibly thankful to the amazing people who have inspired and guided me on this journey. 🙇‍♀️🎓
